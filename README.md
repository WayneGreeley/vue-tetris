# Tetris with a twist - VueJS

This project was an experiment in working with [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/)

Given the single prompt below, Kiro AI created the requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, and wrote all of the code.

## Initial Kiro prompt:

I want to build a clone of the game Tetris using VueJS 3. However I want one big change from the original. I want all the falling game pieces randomly generated on the fly. The random game peices will all include 4 to 7 squares that fit in a 4 by 4 box.

## Running the game instructions

``` 
git clone https://github.com/WayneGreeley/vue-tetris
cd vue-tetris-clone
npm install
npm run dev
```

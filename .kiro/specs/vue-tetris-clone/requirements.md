# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Tetris clone game using Vue.js 3 with a unique twist: instead of using the traditional seven fixed tetromino shapes, the game will generate random falling pieces on the fly. Each randomly generated piece will consist of 4 to 7 connected squares that fit within a 4x4 bounding box, creating endless variety and unpredictability in gameplay.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to play a Tetris-like game with a standard game board, so that I can enjoy the familiar block-falling puzzle mechanics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display a 10-column by 20-row game board
2. WHEN a piece reaches the bottom or lands on another piece THEN the system SHALL lock it in place
3. WHEN a horizontal line is completely filled THEN the system SHALL clear that line and move all pieces above it down
4. WHEN pieces stack to the top of the board THEN the system SHALL end the game
5. WHEN lines are cleared THEN the system SHALL increase the player's score

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want pieces to fall automatically at regular intervals, so that the game maintains its challenging pace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is active THEN pieces SHALL fall down one row at regular time intervals
2. WHEN the game level increases THEN the falling speed SHALL increase accordingly
3. WHEN a player presses the down arrow THEN the current piece SHALL fall faster
4. WHEN a piece cannot move down further THEN it SHALL lock in place immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control falling pieces with keyboard input, so that I can position them strategically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses the left arrow key THEN the current piece SHALL move one column left IF space is available
2. WHEN the player presses the right arrow key THEN the current piece SHALL move one column right IF space is available
3. WHEN the player presses the up arrow key THEN the current piece SHALL rotate 90 degrees clockwise IF the rotation is valid
4. WHEN the player presses the down arrow key THEN the current piece SHALL fall faster
5. WHEN a movement would cause collision with existing pieces or boundaries THEN the system SHALL prevent the movement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want each falling piece to be randomly generated with 4-7 squares, so that I experience unique and unpredictable gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new piece is needed THEN the system SHALL generate a random shape with 4 to 7 connected squares
2. WHEN generating a piece THEN all squares SHALL be connected (each square must be adjacent to at least one other square)
3. WHEN generating a piece THEN the shape SHALL fit entirely within a 4x4 bounding box
4. WHEN a piece is generated THEN it SHALL appear at the top center of the game board
5. WHEN a piece is generated THEN it SHALL have a random color from a predefined palette

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my current score and level, so that I can track my progress and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display the current score starting at 0
2. WHEN lines are cleared THEN the system SHALL award points based on the number of lines cleared simultaneously
3. WHEN the player reaches certain score thresholds THEN the system SHALL increase the level
4. WHEN the level increases THEN the system SHALL display the new level to the player
5. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL display the final score

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a preview of the next piece, so that I can plan my strategy ahead of time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a piece is currently falling THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the next randomly generated piece
2. WHEN the current piece locks in place THEN the previewed piece SHALL become the active falling piece
3. WHEN the previewed piece becomes active THEN the system SHALL generate and display a new preview piece
4. WHEN displaying the preview THEN it SHALL be shown in a separate area next to the main game board

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to have proper collision detection, so that pieces interact realistically with the board and each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a piece moves or rotates THEN the system SHALL check for collisions with existing pieces
2. WHEN a piece moves or rotates THEN the system SHALL check for collisions with board boundaries
3. WHEN a collision would occur THEN the system SHALL prevent the movement or rotation
4. WHEN rotating a piece would cause collision THEN the system SHALL attempt wall kicks before preventing rotation
5. IF wall kicks fail THEN the system SHALL prevent the rotation entirely

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to be responsive and visually appealing, so that I have an enjoyable gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game renders THEN it SHALL display smooth animations for falling pieces
2. WHEN lines are cleared THEN the system SHALL show a visual effect before removing the lines
3. WHEN pieces lock in place THEN there SHALL be a brief visual indication
4. WHEN the game is played THEN it SHALL maintain consistent frame rates for smooth gameplay
5. WHEN the game is displayed THEN it SHALL use a clean, modern UI design appropriate for Vue.js 3
